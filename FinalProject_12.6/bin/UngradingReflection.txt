I propose an A for my course grade as over the course of this semester there were very few repeated red errors in my code. 
Considering my attendance record, and the completion of my assignments. Additionally earlier in the semester I had decent class participation. 
With code that consistently completed the objective set before me, I believe I deserve an A. I think the quality of my code overall has been greater since the midterm with few exceptions.  
As the difficulty since the midterm has increased the overall completion and quality of my code has as well. As I missed 
exactly zero assignments this semester I maintain my argument. During the semester I feel I have grown significantly 
as a programmer even if my answers are not quite there at 8am. Holding myself to a higher standard this semester has 
taught me a lot about the best ways to code. Iâ€™ve spent the semester holding myself to this standard and managing my time so 
that I did not get overwhelmed. While attempting to identify my errors each week it became quite hard to find any, and I kept 
finding new ways to critique my code in order to improve the quality of it This is why I believe I deserve an A in this class.
